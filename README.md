# Grokbot

Grokbot is a fun and interactive Discord bot built with the `discord.py` library. It uses AI-powered features from xAI and OpenAI to answer questions, roast users, give motivational advice, and even create voice messages. Whether you want a laugh, a pep talk, or a quirky reaction, Grokbot brings a unique flair to your Discord server!

## Features

Grokbot comes with a variety of features to keep your server lively:

- **AI Responses**  
  Grokbot can reply to questions or prompts with clever answers powered by either xAI or OpenAI's language models. Users can pick their preferred AI service using the `/selectapi` command‚Äîgreat for experimenting with different AI styles!

- **Slash Commands**  
  These are the main ways to interact with Grokbot:  
  - **`/selectapi`**  
    Lets you choose between xAI or OpenAI for AI responses. For example, pick xAI for a unique twist or OpenAI for a familiar tone.  
  - **`/airoast`**  
    Creates a hilarious, AI-generated roast of a specified user, pulling inspiration from their nickname and avatar. Add optional context for an extra-personalized burn!  
  - **`/aimotivate`**  
    Delivers over-the-top, cheesy motivational advice to a user. Perfect for a dramatic pick-me-up, with optional context to tailor the vibe.  
  - **`/aitts`**  
    Generates a voice message using OpenAI‚Äôs text-to-speech. Type your text, pick a voice (like "alloy"), and hear it come to life‚Äîoptionally with added context.  
  - **`/checklog`**  
    Shows the last 50 lines of the bot‚Äôs log file. This is restricted to the bot owner for troubleshooting or monitoring.  
  - **`/setreactuser`**  
    Sets a specific user whose messages will get an automatic rainbow flag emoji reaction (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà). Only the bot owner can use this to spotlight someone special.

- **Message Reactions**  
  Once a user is set with `/setreactuser`, every message they send gets a rainbow flag emoji reaction. It‚Äôs a fun way to highlight a friend‚Äîor annoy them playfully!

- **Logging and Error Handling**  
  Grokbot keeps a detailed log of its actions in a file and quietly handles common Discord connection hiccups, so it stays online and reliable.
