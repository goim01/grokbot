# AI Bot

My personal Discord bot that users in a discord server can use to ask to an AI
You can decide which API to use xAI (Grok) or OpenAI (ChatGPT) (using the /selectapi command)
You can directly @ the bot or reply to one of it's messages and it should respond

This was written just as a personal project (because I was bored and needed a good project to learn python)
